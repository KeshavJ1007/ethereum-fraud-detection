# Ethereum Fraud Detection
Fraud and legitimate transactions across Ethereum-a form of cryptocurrency-are represented in this dataset. Ethereum, founded by Vitalik Buterin and Gavin Wood in 2015, is the second most widely used cryptocurrency in the world after Bitcoin. Today, market capitalization for Ethereum represents more than 17% of the $1.2 trillion global crypto market.

That is what distinguishes Ethereum from the actual crypto: unlike Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum was meant to be much more than a medium of exchange or a store of value. Instead, Ethereum is intended as decentralized computing network, blockchain-based.

# Is ERC20 the same as ETH?
What is difference ETH and ERC20? ETH is a native cryptocurrency of Ethereum network, it allows a company to make transactions on Ethereum blockchain.

This standard for fungible tokens created using the Ethereum blockchain is called Ethereum Request for Comment 20, or ERC-20. ERC-20 is a guide for the creation of new tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring such tokens are interchangeable with other smart contract tokens. ERC20 is the protocol that allows for the creation of Ethereum-based tokens, which can be utilized and deployed in the Ethereum network.
